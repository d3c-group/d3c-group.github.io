# Statistical Learning and Inference for Data Science

The process of learning models and inferring quantities from data lies at the heart of several fields of study, including machine learning, signal
processing and statistics. Such fields aim to aid or automate decision making using data. The goal of this PhD-level course is to provide a solid
statistical foundation for the process of turning data into decisions.
