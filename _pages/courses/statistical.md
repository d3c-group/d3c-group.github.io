# Statistical Learning for Data Science

![title](../../images/courses/fig_statisticallearning_small.jpg)

The process of learning models and inferring quantities from data lies at the heart of several fields of study, including machine learning, signal
processing, control theory, and statistics. Such fields aim to either aid or automate decision making using data. The goal of this PhD-level course is to provide a solid
statistical foundation for researchers in related fields.

We will tackle certain important issues in parameter inference and policy evaluation that are not adequately addressed in conventional
machine learning and statistics textbooks.
